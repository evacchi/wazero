// File is a writeable fs.File bridge backed by syscall functions needed for ABI
// including WASI and runtime.GOOS=js.

// Implementations should embed UnimplementedFile for forward compatability. Any
// unsupported method or parameter should return syscall.ENOSYS.
//
// # Errors
//
// All methods that can return an error return a syscall.Errno, which is zero
// on success.
//
// Restricting to syscall.Errno matches current WebAssembly host functions,

// hard coded values and panics otherwise. More commonly, WASI maps syscall
// errors to u32 numeric values.
